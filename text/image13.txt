THE INFAMOUS PIZZA DATE. This day makes me giggle. I raelly really wanted to cook with you, and I saw so many tiktoks about making pizza as a date and I thought that sounded really cool. It was indeed incredibly awesome. We are definitely running this date back. I also think this day was really funny because it was the first official time you came over and my mom seemed very stressed out about having you over for the first time to have you cook. I think it was immediately obvious to everyone around me just how much I liked you and looking back on these memories makes me realize that a big reason everyone around me seemed so invested and freaked out was because they could see just how unbelievably much I liked you. I think that's a really really nice thought. I love you so much.
