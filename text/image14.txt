This picture is so funny to me now. It was my lockscreen for SO LONG. I don't think we look like this anymore, but I really like this picture mostly for what it represents. I think it really encapsulates the vibe of our relationship. It feels goofy because why am I in a onesie (with my hood on), but it also feels so warm. I think it's really really nice to see how purely happy we both look. We both look so incredibly happy in this picture. This whole night felt so warm and happy and I really really liked it. That summer feels so long ago, but it was so awesome. I loved falling in love with you that summer, and I've loved falling more and more in love with you every day since.
