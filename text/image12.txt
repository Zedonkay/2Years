I like this picture a lot. It's another old picture of us, but I think the ball proposals were the first big indication that we were gonna be a really cool couple. Like who does ball proposals like that. We're so awesome. I think those were for a long time some of my favorite stories of us because they really highlighted how cool we are. I think thinking back on some of those things is what led to me making this because I still think we're by far the most awesome couple I know. I also think it's incredible how much effort and attention we gave each other so early on, and now 2 years later we're so much in love but still like each other enough to put in the same effort. I'm so excited to fall more and more in love with you for the rest of my life, but also very very excited to keep planning cool surprises and nice things for you. You're my soulmate and I'm going to spend the rest of my life trying to make you smile. I love you so much.
