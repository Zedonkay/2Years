I know you don't really like this image but I had to include it because it feels so pure. It feels like a moment of brief and sheer ecstacy found in doing absolutely nothign with you. Moments like that are always my favorites and the moments that play through my head when I really miss you. I never thought I'd find so much joy in doing nothing but there truly is nothing I love more in this world than doing nothing with you. I love how in my best times and in my worst times, you are my first thought. You are my first thought when I wake up and my last thought when I go to bed every night.
