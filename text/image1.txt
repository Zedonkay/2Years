This is one of my favorite pictures of you. You look so effortlessly beautiful. You truly are the most incredibly gorgeous person I've ever been so lucky to see. This was such a beautiful day with you. I love the lighting in this picture. I feel like it really captured how every single moment with you feels so calm and warm. You make every moment that much more worth living. This day also made me happy because it was so funny Shanush when we walked around the abandoned skate park.
