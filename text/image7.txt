This is another picture I love because it shows how far we've come. You can't really see us in this picture but from what you can see we seem very mature. It's incredible to me how much the two of us have grown together throughout the course of our relationship. It's also amazing to me that I'm going to have the priveledge of watching how you grow throughout the rest of your life. You challenge me to be better every single day of my life and I'm so lucky to be able to go through life with you. I love you.
