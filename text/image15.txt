We are so gone in this picture. Looking at it now I can really see it. We look so blasted. I think looking back on this day it was quite nice. I do think we got a bit too high, but I thought it was rally nice to be there for you on this day. I thought it was also really nice to explore around on this day. It truly was a very very nice day, but more than anything else this picture makes me giggle because we look so blasted. I like the stupid degeneracy part of our relationship too and also how well balanced our relationship feels. It feels like we enjoy each others company in the most uptight spiffy situations all the way down to things like this and everything in between and I think that'sa  really nice notion. I love you so much.
