I think this is the image from this day you seemed the least against. I had to include it because it's a really really important image. This image was very important ti include because it was our recelebration of our first date. I really really liked this date and recelebrations in general. To me they really reinforce just how far we've come as a couple and I think it's absolutely incredible how even then we felt so incredibly close and it was already so shocking how much closer we were on that day than the first time we went to that garden. I love you so much and I'm so excited to spend the rest of our lives together and watch not only our relationship grow and change but also to watch you grow and change. I'm so excited to see the heights you'll reach and I'd love nothing more than to be the person in your corner as you reach dizzying heights in life.
