I think this picture is really nice because it shows just how far we've come. It's one of our more recent pictures, and I think it's cool to see how much we've grown. I've looked at a lot of our old pictures and we really have grown up so much. I didn't realize it but you've been in my life for what has been the most transformative period ever and I'd like to think I've been in your life for one of the most life changing periods of your life. I think it really is awesome to look back on just how much we've grown. We've also grown so much as a couple. I think the level of closeness and love we have now is truly remarkeable and it's crazy to think about how when we were at those earlier stages it was already so incredible but now its somehow even more incredible. I love you so much.
