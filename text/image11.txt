Here we have a throwback. I think the ball pictures are really funny because we look really really young (even if you can't really see our faces in this one). I think it's really nice because it highlights just how much we've grown. Even ball time I already felt so close and connected to you which makes it so incredible just how far we've come since that time. I also think that ball day itself was really really awesome for me. It was really nice to go through the whole process to find the clothes and the flower things and figure out how to match for the dance. Then, it was really really nice to walk around and people watch during the event itself. Finally, I really really liked the night where I got a huge insight into who you really were. I think that night felt really really nice because it felt so connected and warm and was so unbelievably awesome. Even then, I knew that we were going to last a long time. Looking back on that memory feels so interesting because in my head it felt like it just happened but now that I'm looking back on it, that was a really really long time ago.
