I love this picture of us. I think in this picture we look like a really handsome couple. This picture feels very much like the kind of picture you one day show to your kids or grandkids to show how you looked back in the day. I also loved going to Vasona park with you. I have so many childhood memories at that park and going there with you felt so special. It felt like I was letting you into my childhood and that made me really really happy. It really added to the whole feeling of having you in my life for my entire life (something I become more and more convinced of every day).
