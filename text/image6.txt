I had to include this picture. I don't love the picture itself, but I think the way we're looking at each other in this picture is really really nice. I loved this day with you too, but I think the fact that we're matching adjacent combined with the way that we're looking at each other makes it one of my favorite pictures to think about. I think this picture shows just how much we love each other and I really really treasure it because it feels so genuine. I love you so much.
