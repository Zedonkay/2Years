This image was chosen because it was another really nice day. 
This was our first time coming back to in person after long distance
and it felt really scary. Not so much coming back to in person but that first long distance period. It was brand new and I had no idea how to operate in a relationship much less a long distance one. Still, I found that break and this day especially to be truly incredible. I thought every part of this day felt so perfect. Going to the pumpkin patch, rediscovering the park, hugging you because you were cold at the park, stubling into Ghirardelli, and then kissing in Ghirardelli square. It all felt so magical and I think it really captures the essence of what it means to be with you. Every single moment with you feels so incredibly magical. I love you so much.
