I like this picture a lot. To me it's the most representative picture of when you came to live with me for TWO WHOLE WEEKS. YIPEEEE. I think this picture feels so representative of that time because this picture feels very living in a hosue together vibes. We're in comfy clothes and we're just realxing in the house. I think those two weeks were very very meaningful to me beause they felt like a sneak peak into the future. The future where one day we will live together. I think given how well those two weeks went, I feel very much as though that future will be incredibly beautiful. I love living with you, it truly is the most awesome thing in the world.
