THIS PICTURE IS SO FUNNY. I had to include one picture that feels more silly. You truly are the funniest person I've ever met. I love how silly you are. You never fail to put a smile on my face because what are you doing half the time. Not in a condescending what are you doing way just in a you're so adorable I love watching all of the cute things you do. I also really liked going to noodles and company with you. It felt nice to go to one of your favorite childhood places (even if it didn't live up to expectations), especially considering that after this we went to Vasona which was one of my childhood favorite places. This whole day felt very very we're together forever typa vibes yk.
