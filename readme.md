# 2 Year Anniversary Present

This project is my 2 year anniversary present to my girlfriend.

Over the past few weeks, I wrote a series of postcards, each with hidden coordinates. When all the coordinates are plotted together, they form the shape of a tulip (spoiler alert: "tulip" is the password).

Once you have the password, you can use this project to look through a collection of images of us and relive some of our favorite memories together.

Happy anniversary! 💐
